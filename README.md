## What is distributed tracing?

Distributed tracing is a method of monitoring and observing service requests in applications built on a microservices architecture.

It tracks and traces requests as they flow through distributed systems or microservice environments, allowing developers and devops teams to gain end-to-end observability into the journey of each request.



**Benifits of Tracing:smiley:** 

* Provides end-to-end visibility into the journey of each request, allowing for better troubleshooting and debugging of performance issues
* Helps pinpoint where failures occur and what causes suboptimal performance
* Enables tracking of application requests as they flow across service boundaries, providing a complete picture of the request trace

**Challenges:sweat_smile:**

* Generating and collecting trace data in high-throughput systems can be challenging, as millions of spans may be generated per minute.
* Managing telemetry clusters.
* Code changes required to enable traces.
