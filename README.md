## What is distributed tracing?

Distributed tracing is a method of monitoring and observing service requests in applications built on a microservices architecture.

It tracks and traces requests as they flow through distributed systems or microservice environments, allowing developers and devops teams to gain end-to-end observability into the journey of each request
